Computer-aided diagnosis tools are becoming popular in modern dental practice, especially for treatment planning and comprehensive prognosis evaluation.
However, the limited availability of large numbers of labeled cases constrains the development of deep learning algorithms for disease analysis.
Therefore, we have organized the STS Challenge with a focus on semi-supervised learning.
These series of challenges aim to develop efficient semi-supervised learning methods to advance computer-aided diagnostic tools in modern dentistry.
